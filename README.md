<h2>HTML Intro:</h2>

HTML is responsible for marking up the content of a website.<br>
HTML structure is called a declarative language.<br> HTML is simple, resilinent and robustness. HTML  is capabble of fixing code errors, and missing or mispelled elements<hr>

<h2>Text Formatting:</h2>

<ul>
<li>HTML is a language used for structuring web pages.</li>
<li>It utilizes tags enclosed in less-than and greater-than symbols to mark different elements.</li>
<li>Tags include opening tags and closing tags.</li>
<li>Example: Opening tag for a paragraph is , closing tag is.</li>
<li>Tags work together to define elements, which are like packages containing content.</li>
<li>Some elements, like paragraphs, require both opening and closing tags.<br></li>
<li>HTML markup gives meaning to content and helps computers understand it.</li>
<li>HTML elements can be nested within each other.</li>
<li>HTML serves as a bridge between human and computer worlds.</li>
<li>An entire HTML document consists of nested HTML elements.</li>
<li>Nesting creates a tree structure like a family tree with parents, children, and siblings</li>
<li>The  browser builds a Document Object Model (DOM) tree based on this structure.</li>
<li>The DOM tree is crucial for CSS or JavaScript interactions.</li>
<li>It represents relationships among elements.</li>
<li>Opening and closing tags wrap content to define elements.</li>
<li>Emphasized text can be created using the <em> tag.</li>
<li>The DOM tree shows how elements are related.</li>
<li>Understanding HTML syntax is fundamental for web development</li>
<li>Proper HTML structure enhances accessibility and usability</li>
<li>HTML elements <em>organize content for effective presentation.</em></li>
</ul>

Certainly! Here are HTML capabilities summarized in 15 points:

1. **Markup Language**: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for structuring and presenting content on the web.

2. **Semantic Elements**: HTML provides semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, etc., which describe the purpose of the content, aiding accessibility and SEO.

3. **Text Formatting**: HTML allows you to format text using elements like `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<u>`, `<s>`, `<sub>`, `<sup>`, etc.

4. **Hyperlinks**: HTML enables the creation of hyperlinks using the `<a>` element to link to other web pages, resources, or locations on the same page.

5. **Images and Multimedia**: HTML supports embedding images (`<img>`), audio (`<audio>`), and video (`<video>`) content into web pages.

6. **Lists**: HTML offers ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists along with list items (`<li>`) for organizing content in a list format.

7. **Tables**: HTML allows the creation of tables (`<table>`) with rows (`<tr>`), columns (`<td>`), headers (`<th>`), and captions (`<caption>`) to display tabular data.

8. **Forms**: HTML provides form elements (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`, etc.) for creating interactive input fields to collect user data.

9. **Metadata**: HTML includes metadata elements like `<meta>` for providing information about the web page, such as character encoding, viewport settings, and keywords.

10. **Document Structure**: HTML defines the overall structure of a web page, including headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and divisions (`<div>`), allowing content organization and layout.

11. **Comments**: HTML supports comments (`<!-- comment goes here -->`) to add notes or explanations within the code without affecting the rendered output.

12. **Embedded Scripts**: HTML allows the inclusion of client-side scripts such as JavaScript (`<script>`) for enhancing interactivity and functionality.

13. **Inline Styles and External Stylesheets**: HTML enables styling content using inline styles (`style` attribute) or by linking to external stylesheets (`<link>` element).

14. **Responsive Design**: HTML, combined with CSS, facilitates the creation of responsive web pages that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

15. **Accessibility Features**: HTML provides features such as alt attributes for images (`alt=""`), ARIA roles and attributes, and semantic markup to improve accessibility for users with disabilities.
