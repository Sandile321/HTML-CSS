<li>HTML is a language used for structuring web pages.</li>
<li>It utilizes tags enclosed in less-than and greater-than symbols to mark different elements.</li>
<li>Tags include opening tags and closing tags.</li>

<li>HTML elements can be nested within each other.</li>
<li>HTML serves as a bridge between human and computer worlds.</li>
<li>An entire HTML document consists of nested HTML elements.</li>
<li>Nesting creates a tree structure like a family tree with parents, children, and siblings</li>
<li>The  browser builds a Document Object Model (DOM) tree based on this structure.</li>
<li>The DOM tree is crucial for CSS or JavaScript interactions.</li>
<li>It represents relationships among elements.</li>
<li>Opening and closing tags wrap content to define elements.</li>
<li>Emphasized text can be created using the <em> tag.</li>
<li>The DOM tree shows how elements are related.</li>
<li>Understanding HTML syntax is fundamental for web development</li>
<li>Proper HTML structure enhances accessibility and usability</li>

<h1>HTML Capabilities</h1>
Structure: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is primarily used for structuring web documents, defining the layout and arrangement of content elements such as text, images, and multimedia.

Semantic Markup: It allows the use of semantic elements like `<header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <footer>`, etc., which provide meaning to the content and aid accessibility and search engine optimization.

Text Formatting: HTML enables text formatting through tags like `<strong>, <em>, <u>, <del>, <sup>, <sub>, <b>, <i>`, etc., allowing for emphasis, underlining, strikethrough, superscript, and subscript.

Links and Anchors: HTML supports hyperlinks with the <a> tag, allowing users to navigate between different web pages or sections within the same page through anchor elements.

Lists: Lists can be created using `<ul> (unordered lists), <ol> (ordered lists), and <li>` (list items) tags, providing options for organizing content in bullet points or numbered formats.

Images and Multimedia: HTML facilitates the integration of images (`<img> tag`) and multimedia content (e.g., audio and video using `<audio>` and `<video> tags)`, enhancing the visual and auditory aspects of web pages.

Forms: HTML offers form elements such as `<input>, <select>, <textarea>, <button>`, etc., enabling user interaction and data submission, crucial for tasks like user registration, surveys, and e-commerce.

Tables: HTML allows the creation of tabular data structures using the <table>, `<tr> (table row), <td> (table data), and <th> (table header)` tags, facilitating the display and organization of data in rows and columns.

Metadata: HTML supports metadata through elements like <meta> tags, allowing developers to specify information such as character encoding, page description, keywords, authorship, and viewport settings.

Accessibility and SEO: HTML provides features such as alt attributes for images, semantic markup for improved accessibility, and structured data elements for search engine optimization (SEO), ensuring that web content is accessible and discoverable by both humans and search engines.
 
<h1>HTML Navigation and Linking</h1>

<h3>HTML Links</h3>
<ul>
<P><li>When we want to create a link, we use the A element, which stands for anchor. To do this, we need to add an href attribute with a URL enclosed in quotes.</li>
<li>This URL is where the link will take us.</li> 
<li>The term href stands for Hypertext Reference, a nerdy phrase from the past. Between the opening and closing A tags, we can place text or images, or both, to make them clickable.</li> 
<li>For example, we can turn the phrase "this is a link" into an actual link that takes us to example.com when clicked.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Main Navigation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each link is wrapped in an element with the correct URL, and then enclosed in an "li" element to create a list of links.</li> 
<li>To maintain the order, wrap the whole list in a "ul" element, which represents an unordered list.</li>  
<li>Encompass the entire menu in a "nav" element to indicate that it is the site's navigation.</li>
</ul>
